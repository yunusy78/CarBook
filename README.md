Carbook Udemy Course Project
The course is developed using ASP.NET Core API 8.0 and embraces the principles of Onion Architecture. 
Project Details
🏗️ Onion Architecture: Project layers have been meticulously separated, fostering a sustainable, scalable, and easily maintainable structure. Keeping core business logic, infrastructure, and the user interface independent has been key to this success.

🌐 Backend and Frontend Separation: Backend and frontend are clearly separated using MVC, JavaScript, and .NET 8.0 API. A robust infrastructure and dynamic user interface are achieved through a modular structure and efficient communication.

Project Stages
🏗️ Fundamental Topics Covered: Onion Architecture, CQRS, MediatR Pattern, .NET API, MVC, and other fundamental topics have been successfully covered.

🌐 Upcoming Steps: Future steps include significant topics such as an Admin Dashboard, Google charts, and venturing slightly beyond the scenario with features like Stripe payment for car reservations and implementing IdentityServer6. In this phase, the project will get closer to real-world scenarios, deepening the application development process.
